As the description said this is a basic version of Pong build on Java featuring a single player mode aswell as the option to play together on the same device. 
To play you'll first need to download all the files and put them in the same folder. Open your CMD and select the folder with 'cd'(change directory)---> cd C:\User\name\Desktop\Folder .
Once in the folder type 'java PongGame' into your command bar, the game should open in a seperate window.
The controls are the following:
Left side:
  W -UP
  S -DOWN
Right side:
  ARROW UP -UP
  ARROW DOWN -DOWN


Note that this is just a test version so bugs are to be expected, still I hope you enjoy.
